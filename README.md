# FilterApp

This application is made for applying filters on an Radiometric JPEG. It takes raw input for the purpose of the project.

I have created an Image class which has the ability to read raw image, get resolution sizes, and a mask function to give any asked array of the image.

I have also created a filter array input tool on the GUI which takes an integer array to use on the multiply filter.

I will update the README file when it is done.
